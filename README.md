# Exploring the Relationship Between Turbidity and Environmental Factors
## A Linear Regression Analysis of Beach Observation Data in Toronto (2015-2023)
## Overview
This study investigates the dynamics of water quality in Toronto's beaches, focusing on turbidity. Utilizing the extensive 'Toronto Beach Observation Dataset,' collected by Bylaw Enforcement Officers, the analysis explores intricate interactions between environmental factors and turbidity levels. By comparative analyses between Marie Curtis East Beach and Sunny Side Beach reveal, differences in turbidity levels are discovered, indicating variations in water quality. Through the application of multi-linear regression modeling, these relationships are quantified, providing valuable insights to guide informed decision-making. However, there are weaknesses and challenges in this study, such as data limitations and model uncertainties, highlighting the need for continuous research. Overall, this study contributes to understanding water quality dynamics, facilitating interventions for preserving beach health.
